PROBLEM STATEMENT

Fraud is one of the major issues we come up majorly in banks, life insurance, health insurance, and many others. These major frauds are dependent on the person who is trying to sell you the fake product or service, if you are matured enough to decide what is wrong then you will never get into any fraud transactions. But one such fraud that has been increasing a lot these days is fraud in making payments. In this project we will work on a solution to detect fraud using Data Mining models.

GOALS

The goal to be achieved is to determine whether a given payment is fraud or not.

OBJECTIVE

The objective is to analyze payment behavior based on several variables, determine what variables affect fraud criteria the most, then build a model that can classify if the payment is fraud or not.

DATA

The dataset that we will be using is transaction data for online purchases collected from an e-commerce retailer. The dataset contains more than 39000 transactions, each transaction contains 5 features that will describe the nature of the transactions.
